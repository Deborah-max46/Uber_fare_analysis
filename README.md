# ðŸš– Uber Fare Behavior Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Uber ride fare data using Python and Power BI. It explores fare distribution patterns, trip durations, time-based trends, and weather correlations to deliver actionable business insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Clean and enhance the Uber ride dataset using Python.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand fare behaviors.
- Create interactive, time-aware dashboards using Power BI.
- Simulate weather and trip duration data for richer insights.
- Deliver business-ready visualizations for stakeholders.

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

### ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Extracted `hour`, `day_name`, `month` from timestamps
- Added `trip_duration_min` using simulated values
- Simulated weather attributes (`temperature_C`, `condition`)
- Labeled peak vs. off-peak hours

### ðŸ“Š Visualization & Analysis (Power BI)
- Imported cleaned and enhanced CSV files
- Created interactive visualizations:
  - Fare distribution (histogram, boxplot)
  - Ride durations across hours and weekdays
  - Time series trends (hourly, daily, monthly)
  - Heatmaps and seasonal trends
  - Slicers for day, time, and weather

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **Fares are highest** during peak morning and evening hours.
- **Trip durations** are longer during weekends and evenings.
- **Weather conditions** (simulated) show fare variability in rain and cold.
- **Weekdays show predictable fare patterns**, while weekends are more scattered.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

- Optimize fleet allocation during **peak hours** and **weekend evenings**.
- Consider dynamic pricing strategies during adverse weather.
- Monitor weekday patterns to plan driver availability efficiently.
