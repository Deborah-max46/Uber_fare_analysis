# ðŸ“„ Uber Fare Analysis Report

---

### ðŸŸ£ 1. Introduction: Project Overview and Objectives

This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover patterns in fare pricing, ride durations, and time-based trends. The objective is to understand user behavior, optimize pricing strategies, and support decision-making using Python and Power BI.

---

### ðŸ”µ 2. Methodology: Data Collection and Analysis Approach

- **Dataset**: Uber trip records (enhanced with simulated features)
- **Python**: Data cleaning, feature extraction (hour, day, duration, weather)
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards for visualization
- [Download Power BI Report](uber%20fares.pbix)

- **New Features**: Simulated `trip_duration`, `temperature`, `weather_condition`, and `peak_hours`

---

### ðŸŸ  3. Analysis: Findings and Statistical Insights

- Most fares fall between **$5â€“$25**, with a few high outliers
- Peak hours (7â€“9 AM, 5â€“7 PM) show **higher fare density**
- Longer trips are more common during **weekends and evenings**
- Simulated weather data shows **fare increases in cold/rainy conditions**

---

### ðŸŸ¢ 4. Results: Key Discoveries and Patterns

- Clear **time-based trends**: Fare amounts vary significantly by hour
- **Weekends** show greater ride durations and fare variance
- Weather and time combined influence ride pricing behavior
- Consistent weekday trends suggest predictable commuting patterns

---

### ðŸ”´ 5. Conclusion: Summary of Findings

Uber fares are most influenced by **time of day** and **trip duration**.  
The combination of ride timing, simulated weather, and duration provides a solid base for predicting fare behavior.

---

### ðŸŸ¡ 6. Recommendations: Data-Driven Suggestions

- Increase driver availability during **peak hours**
- Implement **dynamic pricing** during adverse weather or weekend surges
- Use **ride time predictions** to improve app fare estimates
- Offer **discounts or promos** during off-peak hours to balance demand
